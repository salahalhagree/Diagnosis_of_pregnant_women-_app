 Normally during pregnancy, erythroid hyperplasia of the marrow occurs, and red blood cell (RBC) mass increases. However,
 a disproportionate increase in plasma volume results in hemodilution (hydremia of pregnancy): hematocrit (Hct) decreases 
 from between 38% and 45% in healthy women who are not pregnant to about 34% during late single pregnancy and to 30% during
 late multifetal pregnancy. The following hemoglobin (Hb) and Hct levels are classified as anemic:

If Hb is < 11.5 g/dL at the onset of pregnancy, women may be treated prophylactically because subsequent hemodilution usually reduces Hb to < 10 g/dL. Despite hemodilution, oxygen-carrying capacity remains normal throughout pregnancy. Hct normally increases immediately after birth.
